2.	Add necessary input layers

* **Admin boundaries:** Vector polygon indicating administrative boundaries for the AoI
* **Admin level crop layer:** Vector polygon indicating the following characteristics per admin area (in this case level 2):

1. **state** - name of the state
2. **c_code** - country code 
3. **country** - name of the country
4. **crop** - name of modelled crop
5. **year** - year of data
6. **harv_area_** - harvested area in hectares
7. **yeild** - the yeild, defined as (area of product)/(the production)
8. **product_kg** - the production

**Note!** All layers should be in a reference coordinate systems (e.g. WGS 84). Examples are available in the ```Input_data``` folder.

3.	Run the plugin

If succesful, the ```sample_output_5km.csv``` (or 10km) will be added in the designated workspace (```e.g. Output_data```). Four additional columns are now added to the ones mentioned above:

9. **state_area_ha** - area of the state [ha]
10. **perimeter** - perimeter of the state [km]
11. **lon** - longitude coordinates (in WGS84 EPSG:4326)
12. **lat** - latitude coordinates (in WGS84 EPSG:4326)

**Note!** A more elaborate description of the instructions is available on ```Instructions``` sub-folder.

#### Cautions

As of March 2020 The plugin can only be run on QGIS 3.4 (latest stable version). Note that newer or older version of QGIS will not work
